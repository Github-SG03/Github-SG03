### Hey, I'm Shivam! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Data Engineer passionate about building scalable ETL pipelines and automating workflows. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and cloud technologies like Azure and AWS, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks in the data ecosystem.

I've been working in ETL development for over a year, focusing on data transformation, workflow orchestration, and process automation. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into Snowflake and PySpark to enhance my expertise in big data solutions.
